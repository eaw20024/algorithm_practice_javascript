//Just the Facts, ma'am. Factorials, that is. Write a function factorial(num) that, given a number, returns the product (multiplication) of all positive integers from 1 up to number (inclusive).

//Example: factorial(3) = 6 (or 1 * 2 * 3); factorial(5) = 120 (or 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5).

function factorial(num){
  product = 1;
  for (var i = 1; i <= num; i++){
    product *= i;
  }
  console.log(product);
  return product;
}
factorial(3);
factorial(5);
